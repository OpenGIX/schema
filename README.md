# OpenGIX Schema Documentation

This repository tracks changes for the OpenGIX Shchema specification.

OpenGIX organizes complex data-imbued geometry into geospacial layers to enable interactivity in maps and graphs. Visit https://opengix.org to learn more about the OpenGIX project.

## Quickstart

Import the schema definition as the first line item in your `.yaml` project.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://github.com/OpenGIX/schema/blob/latest/spec/gix.json
```
